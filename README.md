# nvim_config

A simple neovim config.
Clone this repository and put the files in `~/.config/nvim` (Linux) or the equivalent location on your operating system.

The structure is as follow:

- `init.lua`: set the basic parameters, load `lazy.vim` the plugins manager
- `lua/plugins`: it holds several files for configure the various plugins

When the files are deployed as explained above, the first start of neovim will load and install all the plugins. This procedure can take some time depending on your machine and internet speed connection. On my machine, it takes less than a minute anyway.
